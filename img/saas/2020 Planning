Planning

* Problem
	- There is no one size fits all payment processor
		- Merchants - well which is the right fit
		- Platforms - how do i offer choice, maintain and monetise
* Objectives / end game
	- Broker the worlds payments (connecting merchants to the right fit), and enabling choice (the right fit in the platforms they use)
	- The way merchants select a processor
* Market Size
	- Y TPV (Stripe / Checkout / Paypal etc combined)
	- X merchants - mid Tier and below
	- 3,000 payment enabled SaaS  (20% / 80% rule)
* Overall Strategy
	 - Build platform and commercial offering
	 - Grab platform market with defensive mechanism (300 platforms / year)
	 - Monetise / Farm - referral services with platform merchants  
	 - Increase LTV - re-referral / cross sell / upsell to each merchant and better processor agreements
* Assets we're building
	- TPV
	- channel to merchants
	- platform relatioships 	
* Milestones / Phases
	- Seed 2021 - Platform landgrab
		- Scaling traction with referral partners to 30/moth
		- Starting farming process 
	- Series End 2021 - Farming + Scale
		- Scaling the farming process (10 fold existing projections)
	- Series B 	- Growing ARPU / or exit to someone with services that delivers stronger ARPU
		- 
* Modelling
	- 12 pax sales - £750k
	- product support - £400k
	- Farming - £350k => £1.5m so £2m raise


* Positioning
	- Global - no "one size fits all" processor -> shuttle is the best platform for "global payment logistics"
	- To SaaS
		- Monetisation + connectivity (customer acqusition) 
	- To Merchants
		- increased conversion + lower costs + better access to funds (disgrunted due to service, but also price)
	- To Investors
		- The simplest and best way for platforms to monetise payments
