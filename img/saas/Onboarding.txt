Onboarding

There are 3 key components to onboarding

1. Create a Shuttle account for your merchant
2. Check to see if the Shuttle account is ready to process payments
3. Inject our configuration tool into your merchant's setup screen. 

Decide on which screen it makes sense for a merchant to configure payments, and follow the following logic on load:

```
// Server Side

// Fetch if Shuttle is ready to process payments
instance = GET [api]/setup/payments

// If no Shuttle account, create one
if (instance.active == false) {
	POST [api]/instances
}

// Create a deep_link to the merchant configuration screen
POST [api]/deep_links
```

```
// Screen Render

{{if !instance.payments_ready}}
	// Recommended: Include a call to action to configure payments
{{/if}}

// Include a container div for the payments configurator
<div data-shuttle-embed="${deep_link.id}"></div>

// Include this at the bottom of the page
<script src="https://app.shuttleglobal.com/b/web/s/payments-1.2.X.min.js">

// Optional, if the <div> is added to the page or changes AFTER page load, call
Shuttle.bind(); // This will reload the div
```
